## About me

- Colombian/Canadian/American
- Full stack JS developer
- PB & J evangelist

### Origin story

- Born in Montreal to Colombian parents
- Spent most of my life between Bogotá and Portland, Oregon.

### Linguistics

Being raised by tri-lingual parents, I became fascinated with how languages work
and how we use them. I ended up pursuing Bachelor of Arts in Linguistics at the
University of British Columbia.

That interest lead me to Statistics, Natural Language Processing and eventually
web development.

### Work, work, work

I consider myself really lucky with how my career has developed!

- Contractor for various government programs in Java
- Became interested in the young Node.js scene
- Started working for CuriosityMedia on
  [SpanishDict.com](http://www.spanishdict.com/) in Washington, DC
- Moved to Medellín, Colombia and worked remotely
- Traveled through Europe while working remotely
- Took 6 months off to travel through South East Asia while working on side
  projects and learning new technologies

### Community

Because I entered programming through a "non-traditional path", I'm really
interested in helping others get started in the industry.

- Helped establish [NodeSchool DC](https://nodeschool.io/washingtondc/)
- Previously organizer for [NodeDC](https://www.meetup.com/node-dc/).
- Tech conference speaker and workshop leader
