I decided to check this out because [[Maggie Appleton works there]]. She gave a
talk at the Women of React conference that was really inspiring! And her
drawings are great.

# Courses that would be interesting
- Postgres
- Typescript
  - This has become more and more relevant in the industry and I'd like to know
    how to make myself productive in it
- Cypress
- Figma
  - This would be a good way to get more experience with design
- Node.js
  - This might be good so that I can study for that certification
- [[VSCode]]
  - I was disappointed to find that a lot of these were taken down or not very
    good.
- Mobile design
  - I think I need to set `maximum-scale=1` on my website, to prevent pinch zoom
