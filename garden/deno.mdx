## Thoughts
- I'm surprised that they even have thought out plans for managing versions,
  like right away linking you to something like [[asdf]]
- Though it's a cool idea that you can provide the command line a url and it
  will run it, it feels really strange coming from the node world of needing to
  at least put everything in a file first
- Being able to do set up in window.onload and cleanup in window.onunload is a
  really nice parallel to web pages
- The order of loaded events seems a little confusing, I wonder if this would be
  clearer with a visual?
- Built in support for workers, what does this mean for performance?
