Welcome to my garden!

The idea of a digital garden is that rather than sharing only perfectly flushed
out blog pages, we can frequently share our thoughts through writing, and posts
will grow and mature over time.

Here's a [quick explanation](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) of digital
gardens.

I got this idea from [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/garden), and she maintains a
collection of [many other gardening resources](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners)

If you've landed here, let me know if any of these [[ideas]] are things you'd like
to learn more about.
