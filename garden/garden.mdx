Welcome to my garden!

I got this idea from [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/garden), and she maintains a
collection of [many other gardening resources](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners)

If you've landed here, let me know if any of these [[ideas]] are things you'd like
to learn more about.

## Gardening log

- I decided to try out [[Obsidian]] since I've heard about it as an alternative
  to [[Roam Research]]
- I don't really know what the goal here is going to be. I'm mostly just going
  along and we'll see as we go!
- Maybe I could redirect /now to /garden/now and have that in the garden as well

Today I was able to set up the plugin and deploy to my site my first version of
this garden!

I've been thinking that the best strategy to get started is to not worry about
getting it right and instead just try to put a lot of it out.

That's sort of the idea with [[learning in public]] right? That as you go you
record your thoughts instead of trying to get it all best the first time around
