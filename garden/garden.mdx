Welcome to my garden!

I'm Juan, a Colombian, Canadian, American Full-Stack Javascript developer.

I got this idea from [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/garden), and she maintains a
collection of [many other gardening resources](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners)

If you've landed here, let me know if any of these [[ideas]] are things you'd like
to learn more about.

If you want to see what's new, you can check out my [[gardening log]].
