## Things I like
- Being able to press SPC SPC to open any command
- Org mode
  - This is probably one of the best things about emacs!
  - The fact that headers and lists are no different is a big deal

## Things I dislike
- These errors are starting to become a real pain when working on the garden.
  ```
  Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'garden/.#combining-react-hooks.md'
  ```
  - Though I think this is actually a bug in [[gatsby-theme-brain]]
