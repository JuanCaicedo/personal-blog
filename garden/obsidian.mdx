- I downloaded this to try it out
- I like that it gives me a UI for editing markdown notes that is separate from
  my editor
- The interface for markdown is much nicer looking than [[Spacemacs]]
- I wasn't able to set up a key binding to easily open up the sidebar
- Many of my other keyboard bindings seem to clash
- It surprisingly doesn't understand frontmatter, which seems to me to be a
  common feature in markdown
- I wonder if there's a way to render MDX through Obsidian? I'm sure that it
  does only markdown as a default, and I'm sure that executing components is
  quite a leap
