title: Empathizing with your users
---

- Comes from the idea that the best way to build fast and reliable websites for
  slower machines and networks is to purposely have developers use old machines
  for their job
  - I'll admit this is something that I like in theory, but have never tried
- The core of this idea is that when developers test on the best hardware, we
  suffer of the best-case-scenario-bias
  - I think of this as how we tend to solve the most salient problems we
    experience as developers
  - If we are always testing with the best hardware, we never see the problems
    that might crop up on less good hardware
- This is also similar to [[testing the happy path]], a problem in which we
  test the situations in which our code works, but fail to consider the many
  edge cases in which it might not work
- Today I got bit by a bug of another sort, similar sort
  - I was testing removing permissions from my current user to a shared
    repository of data
    - When I removed my permissions to the data, I should no longer be able to see
      it
    - I was stuck for a while because even after removing the permissions, I could
      still access the data
      - I tested this through the UI and the bug was present
      - I wrote up a unit test to see this bug in action, which was very easy
        using [[Behavior Driven Development]], and was surprised that my tests
        behaved as expected, effectively revoking the permission
      - What was different in the UI? It turns out that I tested everything as a
        super user, and for ease of development, we've given super users access
        to all data in our staging environment
      - By not testing with the same permissions regular uses will have, I was
        completely blind to the point that I was chasing a bug that did not exist
