### What I learned

Having a simple system for externalizing your thoughts improves your learning.
It provides a scaffolding on which to build up your understanding and reduces
the barrier towards creating new content.

### The key steps

1. Take short fleeting notes anytime you read. These serve as reminders of
   things that stand out to you and where you found them. Questions, critiques,
   and associations are particularly valuable.
2. Translate fleeting notes into literature notes. These distill the most
   important ideas into your own words. They should be as short as possible
   while containing enough information so that you don't need to refer back to
   the literature afterwards.
3. Consolidate literature notes into permanent notes. These capture what you
   consider to be relevant to your personal interests.
4. Create connections between permanent notes. These help you find interesting
   relationships between ideas, and is usually the source of creativity.
5. Use your permanent notes to build up new content.

### Why new content?
When you create something new, you are forced to understand it more, and in
doing so remember all the supporting information much more. You are creating
associations between your own words and other concepts, and because humans have
a greater capacity for understanding related ideas rather than discrete facts,
you are actually improving your memory.

Think of it like installing hooks on a wall. Once you have a hook, you can
hang other things off of it. Doing so makes it much easier to find those things
later.

This was a really empowering idea, and these notes are an example of that.
