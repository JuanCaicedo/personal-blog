## Why leave [[emacs]]
Sometimes emacs causes problems that annoy me like
```
Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'garden/.#deno.mdx'
```

## Typescript
I think one of the best things for [[typescript]] is that it can have better
tooling.

## Tooling
- I remember from when I used to be a Java developer that the best thing was
  getting autocomplete. That's something that I've missed as a JS developer

## Vim
- Need to support dvorak navigation
  - Maybe the best way to do this `keybindings.json`?
    - https://vscode.pro/tip/23/
    - Can use the when clause to check if I'm in insert mode or not
      https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim#-faq
  - Wow, this is surprisingly complicated
    - I want to bind a key to move left
    - But there is no cursorLeft
    - I have to make my own, but that involves writing an extension
    - Might be able to call vscode-vim.vim_left in
  - How do you try out an extension without needing to publish it?
    - You have to edit it with VSCode and then run cmd+shift+e to debug it
