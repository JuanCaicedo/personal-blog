## Why leave [[emacs]]
Sometimes emacs causes problems that annoy me like
```
Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'garden/.#deno.mdx'
```

## Typescript
I think one of the best things for [[typescript]] is that it can have better
tooling.

## Tooling
- I remember from when I used to be a Java developer that the best thing was
  getting autocomplete. That's something that I've missed as a JS developer
