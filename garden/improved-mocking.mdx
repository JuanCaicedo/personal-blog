title: Improved mocking
---

This idea came from reading this [blog
post](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/stop-mocking-fetch) from Kent Dodds.

## Pain points
- We have an application that accumulated a bad pattern because of how we were
  trying to mock out our data for Cypress tests
  - I mentioned this before in [refactoring when it's hard]
    - Eventually we had to declare bankrupcy with this pattern and scrap our
      Cypress tests all together
  - Our Storybook tooling suffers from a similar problem
    - This is because the components that we want to render have Apollo hooks
      for loading data embedded in them, making them hard to stub out
      - The solution for mocking these is not very nice, and often causes
        headaches
