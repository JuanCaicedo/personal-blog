title: Ego and programming
---

My buddy Jose is putting together an article about ego and programming. I think
it's a cool idea in that he talks about how a lot of the challenges that we face
when trying to solve technical problems are all internal and midset driven.

Another thing that's cool is that it captures a lot of the ideas of popular book
that we are both into like Ego is the Enemy and applies them to software
engineering. That's a good way to blend two worlds.
