title: Plugin for creating a digital garden in Gasby
---

- This is the link that I use for my [[digital garden]]

### Improvements
#### Support emacs working files
- I use [[spacemacs]] for tending my garden
  - It creates an autosave file for anything you are currently editing, like
    `garden/.#empathizing-with-your-users.mdx`
  - This file is added and then removed
- `gatsby-theme-brain` throws an error
  ```
  Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'garden/.#empathizing-with-your-users.mdx'

  - get-markdown-notes.js:23
    [personal-blog]/[@aengusm]/gatsby-theme-brain/src/get-markdown-notes.js:23:24

  - Array.map

  - get-markdown-notes.js:17 module.exports
    [personal-blog]/[@aengusm]/gatsby-theme-brain/src/get-markdown-notes.js:17:6
  ```
- Other node tools don't seem to have this problem
- My suspcion is that this file gets added to the build because it exists, but
  then it is never full removed
- If I try to run the build with an unsaved file (at least with the npm linked
  setup), the error is also thrown
  ```
      if (!expr) {
        const e = new Error("debugging");
        console.error("e.stack", e.stack);
      }
  ```
  - Doesn't seem to provide useful info, just the same thing that's showing up
    in the logs

##### Approach
- Clone `gatsby-theme-brain` and link my local blog to it
- Look into how the build works
  - I've seen `chokidar` used a lot, is this part of what it does?
  - What's the common way of watching files with node? Maybe nodemon, babel, or
    webpack tool is a good example
- After looking into this, the best approach might be to just allow the client
  to exclude certain files. This would keep the lib from encoding much of the
  internals of my environment

##### Notes
- I don't know much about how to write a [[Gatsby]] plugin, I probably would
  want to look into that more
- I'm having trouble setting up my dev environment, I'm seeing this error in the
  logs when running linked version with `npm link @aengusm/gatsby-theme-brain`
  ```
  ERROR

  UNHANDLED REJECTION expr is not a function



    TypeError: expr is not a function

    - source-nodes.js:57
      /Users/juan/code/personal/gatsby-theme-brain/src/source-nodes.js:57:21
    - interpreter.js:650 Interpreter.exec
      [gatsby-theme-brain]/[xstate]/lib/interpreter.js:650:24
  ```
  - It seems like `expr` is coming through as undefined when it gets used. That's
    confusing though, because it's in a file that's not in this repo
  - Would it be possible to see who is calling the `log` that throws this error?
  - I think that this was a bug introduced
    [here](https://github.com/aengusmcmillin/gatsby-theme-brain/commit/ccc3b237fc299ae2718fada09901825a0efa51b6#diff-142987439dc1a1a523e05892a9e2d296R69).
    I think that it could be addressed by setting a default behaviour for that log
    instead of passing undefined
- What is xstate? it seems to be wrapping the chokidar steps
