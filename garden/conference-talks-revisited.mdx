title: Conference talks revisited
---

One of the most important things is being willing to admit when you're wrong.

Over the years, I've given lots of conference talks and with them I've given
lots of advice.

Looking back, a lot of it has turned out to be bad advice.

Here I wanted to take a second to look through some of these talks and mention
how my thinking on them has changed.

### Better JSON through streams

In this talk, I looked at a library called Oboe.js for loading and parsing JSON.
In it I recommended using this library so that you can access data from a big
JSON object before all of it has been parsed and ready to use in memory.

In hindsight, I don't think there are many scenarios where you would want to do
this.

On the browser side, Oboe replaces whatever other method you would use for
fetching data and allows you to write a [[DSL]] to subscribe to events when certain
nodes in that data are found.

If you find yourself sending so much data over the network that it can't be
easily parsed out by your client, it is probably a better solution to evaluate
how you're sending that data. If the data isn't all available at once and you
would like to make it available in an event-driven interface, you might be
better served by reworking your server-side to expose a websocket.

On the server side, the case is pretty similar. If you find yourself needing to
represent data in a stream, there are many good tools for doing that and you
probably don't want to add an extra DSL to do that.

The concepts behind streaming data transfer are very good to understand and this
talk served as away for me to learn about them. If I were to give this talk
again, I would drop Oboe.js completely and instead focus on event architectures
and how streaming is just an implementation of that.
