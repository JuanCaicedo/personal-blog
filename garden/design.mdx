title: Design

I kind of always think that the styles on my site look a little frumpy, but I
get intimidated thinking about design and never end up too happy with what I
manage to put together.

## Color palette
- I generated this randomly based on the first color, using https://mycolor.space/?hex=%233182CE&sub=1
  - Blue #3182CE
  - Dark Grey #3F4756
  - Light Grey #A2ACBD
  - Light red #C65B7D
  - Dark red #8D264D
- Additional colors
  - Yellow #DCA11D
  - Brown #FFEDCB
  - Background white
    - Not sure if it's a good idea to use a background different from normal
      white, since most people have that, at least it will blend in

## Process

- It's looking like it will be involved to go into tailwinds and change the
  color. I wonder if for now I can just hard code them and move on
- A lot of this is looking like just stripping away styles I had before and
  seeing what's left
  - I guess that's good though, a minimalist design is probably best in 99.999%
    scenarios
