- I decided to try out [[Obsidian]] since I've heard about it as an alternative
  to [[Roam Research]]
- I don't really know what the goal here is going to be. I'm mostly just going
  along and we'll see as we go!
- Maybe I could redirect /now to /garden/now and have that in the garden as well
  - https://sergiodxa.com/articles/vercel/setup-redirect/
- I moved my resume to the garden because what the hell
- Maybe I should add a 404 page

- Today I was able to set up the plugin and deploy to my site my first version
  of this garden!
- I've been thinking that the best strategy to get started is to not worry about
  getting it right and instead just try to put a lot of it out.
- That's sort of the idea with [[learning in public]] right? That as you go you
  record your thoughts instead of trying to get it all best the first time
  around
