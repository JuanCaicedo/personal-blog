### June 11th, 2020
- Add some notes about [[empathisizng with your users]]

### June 10th, 2020
- Drafted up some notes about a problem I had with [[CSS grid]]

### June 9th, 2020
- I almost didn't do any gardening today, but luckily I remember literally as I
  was about to get in bed.
- It's probably better to do some bad last minute gardening rather than none at
  all, so I'm going to go for it.


### June 8th, 2020
- I've been mulling over an idea about [[combining react hooks]], I'm going to
  try to flush it out more using the garden
  - I'm writing a very quick version of this to get it out quickly
  - A good second step would be to have some more meaningful function names
    here. A good name would add to the explanation of what's going on rather
    than leave the reader to guess.
  - I don't really have the energy to flush this out a lot today. In the spirit
    of shipping more, I'm still going to put it out and later I can edit it.
- One interesting idea I had is that we can use bidirectional links to be able
  to use jargon to make writing more succinct for readers that are familiar with
  it, yet still provide context so that those who are not will not feel lost.
  You can put the jargon word as a link and then a definition of it on it's own
  page.
- What if I were to move all the pages into the garden? All that's really left
  of importance is the homepage, and it would probably look nicer if it were
  rendered through the garden anyway.
  - I would need to figure out how to import images inside of mdx/theme-brain.
    Maybe that's easy, maybe not!


### June 7th, 2020

- I decided to try out [[Obsidian]] since I've heard about it as an alternative
  to [[Roam Research]]
- I don't really know what the goal here is going to be. I'm mostly just going
  along and we'll see as we go!
- Maybe I could redirect /now to /garden/now and have that in the garden as well
  - https://sergiodxa.com/articles/vercel/setup-redirect/
- I moved my resume to the garden because what the hell
- Maybe I should add a 404 page

### June 6th, 2020

- Today I was able to set up the plugin and deploy to my site my first version
  of this garden!
- I've been thinking that the best strategy to get started is to not worry about
  getting it right and instead just try to put a lot of it out.
- That's sort of the idea with [[learning in public]] right? That as you go you
  record your thoughts instead of trying to get it all best the first time
  around
