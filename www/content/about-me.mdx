## About me

My name is Juan Caicedo, I'm a Colombian/Canadian/American full stack JS developer.

I was born in Montreal to Colombian parents and spent most of my life between
Bogot√° and Portland, Oregon. This made me fascinated with how languages work and
how we used them, leading me to pursue a Bachelor of Arts in Linguistics at the
University of British Columbia. That interest lead me to Natural Language
Processing and eventually web development.

After working as a contractor for various government programs in Java, I became
interested in the young Node.js scene and started working for CuriosityMedia on
[SpanishDict.com](http://www.spanishdict.com/) first in the city and afterwards
remotely.

Because I entered programming through a "non-traditional path", I'm really
interested in helping others get started in the industry. When living in
Washington DC I helped establish [NodeSchool
DC](https://nodeschool.io/washingtondc/) and was an organizer for
[NodeDC](https://www.meetup.com/node-dc/). I also give talks an workshops all
over the world to help others learn various javascript topics.
