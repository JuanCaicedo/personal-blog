## About me

My name is Juan Caicedo, I'm a Colombian/Canadian/American full stack JS developer.

I was born in Montreal to Colombian parents and spent most of my life between
BogotÃ¡ and Portland, Oregon. This made me fascinated with how languages work and
how we used them, leading me to pursue a Bachelor of Arts in Linguistics at the
University of British Columbia. That interest lead me to Natural Language
Processing and eventually web development.

After working as a contractor for various government programs in Java, I became
interested in the young Node.js scene and started working for CuriosityMedia on
[SpanishDict.com](http://www.spanishdict.com/) first in the city and afterwards
remotely.

Because I entered programming through a "non-traditional path", I'm really
interested in helping others get started in the industry. When living in
Washington DC I helped establish [NodeSchool
DC](https://nodeschool.io/washingtondc/) and was an organizer for
[NodeDC](https://www.meetup.com/node-dc/). I also give talks an workshops all
over the world to help others learn various javascript topics.
