      <h2>About me</h2>
      <div>
        My name is Juan Caicedo, I'm a Colombian/Canadian/American full stack JS
        developer.
      </div>

      <div>
        I was born in Montreal to Colombian parents and spent most of my life
        between Bogot√° and Portland, Oregon. This made me fascinated with how
        languages work and how we used them, leading me to pursue a Bachelor of
        Arts in Linguistics at the University of British Columbia. That interest
        lead me to Natural Language Processing and eventually web development.

        After working as a contractor for various government programs in Java, I
        became interested in the young Node.js scene and started working for
        CuriosityMedia on{' '}
        <a href="http://www.spanishdict.com/">SpanishDict.com</a> first in the
        city and afterwards remotely.

      <div>
        Because I entered programming through a "non-traditional path", I'm
        really interested in helping others get started in the industry. When
        living in Washington DC I helped establish{' '}
        <a href="https://nodeschool.io/washingtondc/">NodeSchool DC</a> and was
        an organizer for
        <a href="https://www.meetup.com/node-dc/">NodeDC</a>. I also give talks
        an workshops all over the world to help others learn various javascript
        topics.
